Presentations for Engineering Students

## 2022-12-01

Class: **Manufacturing Processes**

Topic:  (up to 1.5hr) The production processes of electrical components and assemblies. My goal is to get a group of primarily mechanical engineering grad students to better understand how electronic items are mass manufactured.

### Outline:

* Introduction
* Component types
  * Chips
  * Passives
  * Connectors
  * Interconnects
  * Boards
* Circuit Design Process
  * Analog vs Digital
  * Circuit design / analysis / simulation / prototype / test
   * Simulation tools and examples
  * Board or module design
   * Input needed (besides a working circuit!)
    * Mechanical considerations
    * Thermal considerations
    * Power considerations
    * EMC considerations
   * Schematic vs physical layout
   * Schematic Capture
   * Footprinting
   * Physical Layout
   * Output Products
   * DFM considerations
  * Manufacturing Processes
   * Chip manufacturing
    * Fabrication
    * Packaging
    * Test
   * Board / Module manufacturing
    * Board fabrication (etch/drill)
    * Rigid vs Flex
    * Bare board test
    * Assembly
     * Pastemask
	* Placement
	* Soldering
	* Thru-hole vs SMT considerations
	* Testing
	* Side note:  COB and odd substrates
